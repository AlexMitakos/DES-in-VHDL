Currently the vhdl code can encrypt binary data 

**To-Do's**

 ```
- Decryption implemented successfully BUT misbehaves. Something's wrong with the subkeys/shifts. Find the bug!!
- fix code intents and looking
- check if it is possible to encrypt/decrypt real data -> take a param in vhdl
- fix running/waiting signal thing
- add comments
- documentation
 ```
